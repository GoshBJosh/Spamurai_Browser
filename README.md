# Spamurai_Browser

Just like a standard ad-blocker, this app removes advertisements from the pages we browse. 

But the goal of Spamurai is to reward sites who've built a relationship with their audience by 
allowing them to display ads. 

Although the current version of Spamurai blanketly blocks all google iframe ads, 
the next step is to have the extention allow ads on sites you've visted on a number of occasions. This will hopefully
promote sites to produce content worth coming back for. And to give users a way to financially support their favorite
websites.

Users will also be able to adjust the filters provided by the extension to display less ads from the sites they visit, 
or none at all.
