# Spamurai™ for Chrome / Firefox

Just like a standard ad-blocker, this app removes advertisements from the pages we browse. 

But the goal of Spamurai™ is to reward sites who've built a relationship with their audience. 

This means allowing ads on sites you repeatedly visit. This will hopefully
encourage sites to produce content worth coming back for. And to give users a way to financially 
support their favorite content creators.

** It's important to note that users will also be able to adjust the filters provided by the extension. This includes 
the ability to display less ads from the sites they visit, or block ads entirely. So this extension doesn't restrict 
people from living ad-free.

**Where we are:**
- Site successfully blocks Google iframe ads on Firefox

**What's Next:**
- Fix Chrome's extension so that it works like Firefox
- Determine how many visits to a site will put them on the 'whitelist', where ads are allowed
- Code whitelist that gets checked when new document is loaded.
- Code filters to allow users to adjust the amount of blocked content.
