# Spamurai_Browser

Just like a standard ad-blocker, this app removes advertisements from the pages we browse. 

But the goal of Spamurai is to reward sites who've built a relationship with their audience. 

Although the current version of Spamurai blanketly blocks all google iframe ads, 
the next step is to have the extention allow ads on sites you repeatedly visit. This will hopefully
encourage sites to produce content worth coming back for. And to give users a way to financially support their favorite
websites.

It's important to note that users will also be able to adjust the filters provided by the extension. This includes 
the ability to display less ads from the sites they visit, or block ads entirely. So this extension doesn't restrict 
people from living ad-free.
